1. "branching": Dynamic crack branching for a Rectangular strip subjected to tensile impulse traction (Sec. 3.1);
2. "branching2": Rectangular strip subjected to tensile impulse traction on the pre-crack faces (Sec. 3.2);
3. "fragmentation": Dynamic fragmentation of a thick cylinder (Sec. 3.3);

4. "arrest": Dynamic crack arrest due to holes (Sec. 4.1);
5. "velocity-toughening": Crack branching and velocity-toughening mechanism (Sec. 4.2);
6. "multiple-branching": Dynamic crack arrest due to holesMultiple branching (Sec. 4.3);
